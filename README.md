AdResponse Anti-AdBlocker
===

Hello there! I'm an awesome plugin that detects when users are using an ad blocker. Along with my detection, I can display multiple types of messages, in multiple areas, asking users to turn off their ad blocker in order to support the site.

Getting Started
---------------

1. Upload the plugin files to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory, or install the plugin through the WordPress plugins screen directly.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' screen in WordPress.
3. Use the AdResponse Anti-AdBlocker options screen to configure the plugin.
